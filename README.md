# MomentSOS

This package implements JuMP models for the moment-SOS hierarchy in polynomial optimization. It is designed for research purposes, with a specific focus on the following properties: 

1. *flexibility* (the user should be able to make changes easily and has a neat access to the underlying JuMP model),
2. *tests* (as much as possible, the code is tested),
3. *fidelity to the mathematical model* (if the user is familiar with the moment-SOS hierarchy, she/he should be able to understand this code).

Other packages with more advanced functionalities include TSSOS, SumsOfSquares, MomentTools.

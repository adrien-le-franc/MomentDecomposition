# MomentSOS.jl

This package implements JuMP models for the moment-SOS hierarchy in polynomial optimization. It is designed for research purposes, with a specific focus on the following properties: 

* **flexibility** (you can make changes easily and have a neat access to the underlying JuMP model),
*  **tests** (as much as possible, the code is tested),
* **fidelity to the mathematical model** (if you are familiar with the moment-SOS hierarchy, you should be able to understand this code).

Other packages with more advanced functionalities include [TSSOS](https://github.com/wangjie212/TSSOS), [SumsOfSquares.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/SumOfSquares.jl), [MomentTools.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicGeometricModeling/MomentTools.jl).
